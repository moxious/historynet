He learned Hebrew from Jewish scholars and produced the first Hebrew grammar written by a Christian (De Rudimentis Hebraicis, 1506). His De Arte Cabalistica (1517) was the first systematic presentation of Kabbalah for a Christian audience written in Latin. Reuchlin became embroiled in a major controversy when he defended Jewish books against destruction, opposing the converted Jew Johannes Pfefferkorn and the Cologne Dominicans. This 'Reuchlin Affair' (1510-1520) became a cause célèbre among humanists across Europe and prefigured the Reformation's conflicts with scholastic authority."

He studied under Johannes Trithemius and traveled extensively across Europe, serving various patrons while defending accused witches and engaging in alchemical and magical pursuits. His later De vanitate scientiarum (1530) paradoxically attacked all human knowledge, leading some to see him as a skeptic and others as a practitioner covering his tracks."

His visionary belief in universal religious harmony and his claim to have met the 'Venetian Virgin' Joanna led to his being declared insane and confined, though he continued writing prolifically."

He argued that Kabbalah provided ancient confirmation of Christian truths, especially the Trinity and the divinity of Christ. His work was condemned by Pope Innocent VIII, but he found protection in Florence under Lorenzo de' Medici. His premature death at 31 cut short a brilliant career, but his synthesis of Kabbalah, Neoplatonism, and Christianity influenced all subsequent Christian Kabbalists."

His medical philosophy integrated alchemical theory, astrology, and mysticism, viewing the human body as a microcosm reflecting the macrocosm. Though not primarily a Kabbalist, his work drew on the same synthesis of Neoplatonism, Hermeticism, and natural magic, and he significantly influenced later occultist traditions.
