## Movement Description

The Rosicrucian-Paracelsian network encompasses the intellectual milieu surrounding the publication of the Rosicrucian manifestos (1614-1616) and the broader current of Christian theosophy, Hermetic philosophy, and Paracelsian medicine in early modern Central Europe.

This network is characterized by overlapping circles of alchemists, mystics, physicians, theologians, and political patrons who shared texts, corresponded, and influenced each other's thinking. The manifestos themselves emerged from the Tübingen Circle but resonated with pre-existing networks of Paracelsian practitioners and spiritual reformers.

## Seed Figures

1. **Jacob Boehme** (1575-1624): Central figure in Christian theosophy; his mystical writings synthesized Lutheran theology with alchemy and Kabbalah. Anchor for the German mystical tradition.

2. **Johann Valentin Andreae** (1586-1654): Lutheran theologian and likely principal author of the Rosicrucian manifestos. Anchor for the Tübingen Circle and the manifesto origins.

3. **Robert Fludd** (1574-1637): Most important English defender of Rosicrucianism. Anchor for English reception and international spread of Rosicrucian ideas.

4. **Michael Maier** (1568-1622): Physician, alchemist, and most important early Rosicrucian apologist. Bridge between Prague court, German networks, and English connections.

## Expected Subgroups

1. **Tübingen Circle**: The scholars at University of Tübingen who created the manifestos (Andreae, Hess, Besold, etc.)

2. **German Mystical Tradition**: Predecessors and parallel figures in Christian theosophy (Weigel, Schwenckfeld, Arndt, Boehme)

3. **Paracelsian Network**: Physicians and alchemists transmitting Paracelsian medicine and philosophy (Khunrath, Croll, Hartmann, etc.)

4. **Prague Court Circle**: Figures around Rudolf II's court, a major center for esoteric thought (Dee, Kelley, Brahe, Kepler)

5. **Manuscript Collectors**: Those who preserved and transmitted texts (Widemann, Figulus, Eglin)

6. **English Rosicrucians**: English reception and development (Fludd, Vaughan, Ashmole)

7. **Political Patrons**: Nobles and rulers who supported esoteric circles (Rudolf II, Frederick V, Moritz of Hesse-Kassel)

8. **Rosicrucian Respondents**: Those who published responses to the manifestos (Maier, Mögling, Haslmayr)

## Exclusion Criteria

- **Later reception**: Cambridge Platonists and post-1660 figures (separate network)
- **Pure scientists**: Figures like Galileo who didn't engage with esoteric currents
- **Catholic mystics**: Spanish and Italian mystics outside the Protestant Hermetic tradition
- **Earlier figures**: Medieval alchemists and mystics before Paracelsus (too early)
