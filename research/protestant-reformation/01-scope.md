## Movement Description

The Protestant Reformation was a major religious, political, and cultural upheaval in 16th-century Europe that challenged the authority and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. Initiated by Martin Luther's posting of the Ninety-Five Theses in 1517, the movement rapidly spread across Germany, Switzerland, England, Scotland, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia, fundamentally reshaping Western Christianity.

The Reformation was not a single unified movement but rather a collection of related reform efforts with distinct theological emphases: Lutheran reform in Germany and Scandinavia, Reformed/Calvinist traditions in Switzerland and Scotland, the English Reformation under Henry VIII and his successors, and the Radical Reformation (Anabaptists). These movements shared critiques of Catholic practices (indulgences, clerical abuses, papal authority) and emphasized Scripture's primacy, but diverged significantly on issues like the Eucharist, church governance, and the relationship between church and state.

This network maps the intellectual and personal connections among the principal reformers, their humanist predecessors, political patrons, opponents, and successors who shaped the first generation of Protestant Christianity.

## Boundaries

- **Temporal**: c. 1483 - 1564 (Luther's birth to Calvin's death), with some figures extending to c. 1580 for second-generation reformers
- **Geographic**: Germany (Holy Roman Empire), Switzerland, England, Scotland, Netherlands, France, with some figures from Italy and Eastern Europe
- **Intellectual**: Protestant theology and reform, Christian humanism, biblical scholarship, church-state relations, early modern political thought

## Seed Figures

1. **Martin Luther** (1483-1546): The initiating figure of the Reformation. Professor of theology at Wittenberg, author of the Ninety-Five Theses, translator of the Bible into German. His network includes the Wittenberg reformers, German princes, humanist scholars, and Swiss reformers with whom he both collaborated and clashed.

2. **John Calvin** (1509-1564): French reformer who became the leading figure of the Reformed tradition in Geneva. His *Institutes of the Christian Religion* became the systematic theology of Reformed Protestantism. Connected to French Reformed circles, Strasbourg reformers, Swiss churches, and English exiles.

3. **Huldrych Zwingli** (1484-1531): Leader of the Reformation in Zurich and founder of the Swiss Reformed tradition. Humanist-trained priest who initiated reform independently of Luther. His network connects Zurich's political leadership, Swiss humanists, and the contentious debates with Luther over the Eucharist.

4. **Erasmus of Rotterdam** (1466-1536): The "Prince of Humanists" whose Greek New Testament and satirical works laid intellectual groundwork for reform while he remained within the Catholic Church. Connected to virtually every major intellectual figure of the era through his vast correspondence network. His relationship with Luther (early ally, later critic) is central to understanding the humanist-Reformation split.

5. **William Tyndale** (c. 1494-1536): English scholar and translator who produced the first printed English New Testament from Greek and Hebrew sources. Worked in exile on the Continent, connected to merchant networks, English reformers, and Continental printers. His translation profoundly influenced the King James Bible.

6. **Thomas Cranmer** (1489-1556): Archbishop of Canterbury under Henry VIII and Edward VI, architect of the English Reformation's liturgical and doctrinal foundations. Author of the *Book of Common Prayer*. Connected to Continental reformers (especially Strasbourg and Zurich), English court politics, and the Marian martyrs.

7. **Philip Melanchthon** (1497-1560): Luther's closest collaborator and systematic theologian of Lutheranism. Humanist scholar who authored the *Augsburg Confession* and worked to maintain Protestant unity. Key mediating figure between Lutheran and Reformed camps, connected to universities across Protestant Europe.
