## Research Notes

### Figures Near Scope Boundary
- **Theodore Beza** (d. 1605): Included as Calvin's immediate successor despite living beyond 1564
- **Matthew Parker** (d. 1575): Included as consolidator of English Reformation under Elizabeth
- **John Knox** (d. 1572): Included as founder of Scottish Kirk

### Potential Additions for Further Research
- Peter Martyr Vermigli (Italian reformer in Strasbourg and England)
- Jan Laski (Polish reformer in England)
- Thomas Müntzer's associates (e.g., Hans Hut)
- Additional French martyrs
- Scandinavian reformers (Hans Tausen, Olaus Petri)
- Women in the Reformation (Argula von Grumbach, Elizabeth of Brandenburg)

### Research Gaps
1. Need to verify all birth/death dates against academic sources
2. Need to document all relationship types and evidence
3. Some peripheral connections need substantiation
4. Women's roles likely underrepresented in sources
