## Movement Description

Renaissance Humanism was the dominant intellectual and cultural movement of the European Renaissance, spanning roughly from the 14th to the 16th century. It represented a rediscovery and reinterpretation of classical Greek and Roman texts, combined with a new emphasis on human potential, individual achievement, and secular concerns alongside (not necessarily replacing) religious faith.

The movement began in Italy, particularly in Florence, where scholars like Petrarch championed the *studia humanitatis*—a curriculum emphasizing grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy based on classical sources. Unlike medieval scholasticism, which focused on logic and theology, humanism celebrated eloquence, civic virtue, and the cultivation of the whole person. The movement spread northward in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, giving rise to "Northern Humanism" or "Christian Humanism," which sought to apply humanist methods to religious reform and biblical scholarship.

Key characteristics of Renaissance Humanism include:
- Revival of classical Latin and Greek learning
- Development of critical philology and textual criticism
- Emphasis on rhetoric and eloquent expression (*eloquentia*)
- Celebration of human dignity and potential (*dignitas hominis*)
- Interest in history as a source of moral exempla
- Civic humanism: engagement with political and public life
- Educational reform based on classical models
- Integration of Platonic and Neoplatonic philosophy with Christian theology

## Boundaries

- **Temporal**: 1304 - 1600
  - *Start*: Petrarch's birth (1304); his career marks the conventional beginning of Renaissance Humanism
  - *End*: ~1600, by which point humanism had transformed into Baroque culture, confessional conflicts dominated Europe, and the movement's distinctiveness had diffused into broader intellectual currents

- **Geographic**: 
  - **Italy** (primary): Florence, Rome, Venice, Milan, Naples, Ferrara, Mantua, Urbino
  - **Northern Europe**: Netherlands/Low Countries, German states, England, France, Spain
  - The network will track the spread from Italian origins to Northern manifestations

- **Intellectual**: Ideas that unite this network include:
  - Classical scholarship and philology
  - Rhetorical education and *eloquentia*
  - Civic engagement and republican ideals
  - Neoplatonism and philosophical synthesis
  - Moral philosophy derived from classical sources
  - Biblical scholarship and religious reform (especially Northern Humanism)
  - Artistic patronage and the integration of visual arts with humanist ideals

## Seed Figures

1. **Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch)** (1304-1374): The "Father of Humanism." Italian scholar and poet whose recovery of classical texts, Latin letters, and passionate advocacy for ancient learning established the template for Renaissance Humanism. His discovery of Cicero's letters and his own literary Latin works inspired generations.

2. **Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam** (1466-1536): The leading figure of Northern Humanism. Dutch scholar whose critical edition of the Greek New Testament, satirical works (*Praise of Folly*), educational writings, and vast correspondence made him the most influential intellectual in early 16th-century Europe. His network of correspondents connects virtually all major Northern Humanists.

3. **Sir Thomas More** (1478-1535): English lawyer, statesman, and humanist. Author of *Utopia*, close friend of Erasmus, and member of the English humanist circle. His life and writings exemplify the integration of humanist learning with public service and religious conviction.

4. **Marsilio Ficino** (1433-1499): Florentine philosopher and head of the Platonic Academy. His translations of Plato, Plotinus, and the Hermetic corpus, along with his synthesis of Neoplatonism and Christianity, shaped Renaissance thought profoundly. Central node connecting Florentine intellectual life.

5. **Giovanni Pico della Mirandola** (1463-1494): Florentine philosopher whose *Oration on the Dignity of Man* is often called the "Manifesto of the Renaissance." His ambitious project to synthesize all philosophical and religious traditions and his 900 theses represent humanism at its most expansive.

6. **Leon Battista Alberti** (1404-1472): Florentine polymath—architect, artist, author, linguist, philosopher, and cryptographer. His treatises on painting, architecture, and the family exemplify the humanist ideal of the *uomo universale* (universal man). Connects artistic practice with humanist theory.

7. **Niccolò Machiavelli** (1469-1527): Florentine political philosopher and statesman. His *The Prince* and *Discourses on Livy* represent humanist engagement with political theory and classical history, though his realism marks a departure from earlier humanist idealism.

## Exclusion Criteria

The following types of figures will generally NOT be included unless they have substantial documented intellectual relationships with core network members:

1. **Artists without humanist writings**: Painters, sculptors, and architects who did not produce humanist texts or engage in documented intellectual exchanges (e.g., most visual artists are OUT unless they wrote treatises or had documented humanist circle membership)

2. **Pure theologians/scholastics**: Medieval scholastic philosophers and theologians who did not engage with humanist methods, even if contemporaneous

3. **Political rulers without intellectual work**: Princes, popes, and patrons are excluded unless they were themselves humanist authors or had documented intellectual exchanges (e.g., Lorenzo de' Medici is IN as a poet and patron; most rulers are OUT)

4. **Post-1600 figures**: The transition to Baroque and confessional culture marks our endpoint; later Neo-Latin scholars are excluded

5. **Reformers without humanist method**: Protestant and Catholic reformers whose work was primarily theological rather than philological-humanist (Luther is borderline; we include him for his humanist connections but focus on those connections)

6. **Scientists of the Scientific Revolution**: Figures like Galileo and Copernicus, while influenced by humanism, belong to a different network focused on the Scientific Revolution

## Scope Considerations

Given the ~200 person limit, we must be selective. Priority will be given to:
1. Figures with documented intellectual relationships (correspondence, collaboration, mentorship, patronage)
2. Authors of influential humanist works
3. Figures who bridge subgroups (e.g., connecting Italian and Northern humanism)
4. Figures with primary source documentation of relationships

We will need to make difficult exclusion decisions, particularly for:
- Minor members of humanist circles
- Peripheral correspondents of Erasmus (his network alone could exceed 200)
- Second-generation followers without original contributions
- Regional figures with limited connections to the main network
