## Validation Notes

### Well-Documented Relationships
- Erasmus's correspondence network is exceptionally well-documented (3,000+ letters survive)
- Florentine Platonic Academy relationships documented in contemporary sources and extensive scholarship
- Chrysoloras's teaching in Florence (1397-1400) well-established

### Relationships Requiring Additional Evidence
- Some Greek émigré teaching relationships need confirmation of specific student-teacher connections
- Some Northern European correspondence relationships inferred from network proximity

### Speculative or Debated Relationships
- Exact nature of Ficino-Pico relationship debated (mentor vs. intellectual peer with disagreements)
- Giovanni Nesi's relationship to both Ficino and Savonarola represents tensions in Florentine thought

### Excluded Relationships
- Artist-humanist connections (Dürer-Pirckheimer noted but Dürer excluded from network)
- Reformation figures (Luther, Melanchthon, etc.) excluded though some humanists later supported Reformation
- Savonarola noted for influence on Pico but excluded as religious reformer
