## Phase Completion

### Phase 1: Scoping
- [x] Define intellectual movement
- [x] Establish temporal boundaries
- [x] Establish geographic scope
- [x] Identify seed people (7 provided by user)
- [x] List major subgroups/circles
- [x] Document in 01-scope.md

### Phase 2: Enumeration
- [x] Research seed person connections
- [x] Expand outward through documented relationships
- [x] Organize individuals into thematic subgroups
- [x] Validate dates against reliable sources (approximate dates noted with c.)
- [x] Document in 02-enumeration.md

### Phase 3: Relationship Mapping
- [x] Document relationships with evidence
- [x] Validate dates against reliable sources
- [x] Flag speculative or debated relationships
- [x] Document in 03-relationships.md

### Phase 4: Objects, Locations, Entities
- [x] Identify key works (books, manuscripts, treatises)
- [x] Identify significant locations (cities, academies, courts)
- [x] Identify relevant entities (organizations, movements)
- [x] Document in 04-objects.md, 05-locations.md, 06-entities.md

### Phase 5: Review and Gap Analysis
- [x] Review all enumerated individuals
- [x] Verify all edge source/target IDs exist
- [x] Check for orphan nodes
- [x] Document issues in 07-review-notes.md

### Phase 6: Conversion to Graph Schema
- [ ] Generate nodes.json
- [ ] Generate edges.json
- [ ] Create manifest.json
- [ ] Validate against GRAPH_SCHEMA.md
- [ ] Place in public/datasets/renaissance-humanism/

## Notes

- Seed figures provided by user: Petrarch, Erasmus, Thomas More, Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, Leon Battista Alberti, Niccolò Machiavelli
- Network spans 1304-1600, from early Italian humanism through Northern Renaissance
- Good balance achieved between Italian and Northern European humanists
- Florentine Platonic Academy well-represented as major hub
- Greek émigrés included as essential for transmission of Greek learning
- Several approximate birth dates need validation (marked with c.)

## Research Gaps Identified

1. Women humanists (Isotta Nogarola, Cassandra Fedele, Laura Cereta)
2. Portuguese humanism (Damião de Góis)
3. Eastern European connections (Polish, Hungarian)
4. Scientific humanism intersection
5. Artist-humanist connections (excluded per scope but documented)
