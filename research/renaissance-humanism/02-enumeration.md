## Research Gaps

1. **Women humanists**: Isotta Nogarola, Cassandra Fedele, Laura Cereta, and others deserve consideration but documentation of network connections varies.

2. **Portuguese humanism**: Underrepresented. Figures like Damião de Góis had connections to Erasmus.

3. **Eastern European connections**: Polish and Hungarian humanism (e.g., Jan Długosz, Janus Pannonius) needs investigation.

4. **Later Italian humanists**: 16th century figures beyond those listed.

5. **Scientific humanism**: Figures at intersection of humanism and emerging sciences.

6. **Date validation needed**: Several birth dates marked "c." need verification against scholarly sources.

7. **Artist-humanist connections**: Dürer, Michelangelo, Raphael had humanist connections but excluded per scope.
