## Research Notes

1. **Evidence Quality**: Most relationships are documented in primary sources (correspondence, memoirs) or established scholarly biographies. Evidence fields cite secondary sources that compile primary evidence.

2. **Gaps**: Some minor figures have fewer documented relationships. The salon hostesses' connections could be expanded with more research into their correspondence.

3. **Directionality**: "Influenced" relationships are directional (A influenced B). Correspondence and acquaintance are typically bidirectional.

4. **Date Precision**: Dates are given where documented. Many relationships lack precise start/end dates.

5. **Next Steps**: Phase 4 will identify objects (works), locations, and entities that provide additional context and evidence for these relationships.
