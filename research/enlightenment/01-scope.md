## Movement Description

The Enlightenment was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated European thought during the 18th century, often called the "Age of Reason." It was characterized by an emphasis on reason, individualism, skepticism of traditional authority (especially religious and monarchical), and the advancement of ideas such as liberty, progress, tolerance, constitutional government, and the separation of church and state.

The movement built upon the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century and sought to apply rational analysis to all aspects of human society—politics, economics, religion, ethics, and social organization. Enlightenment thinkers produced foundational works that influenced the American and French Revolutions, the development of modern democratic theory, classical economics, and secular ethics.

## Boundaries

- **Temporal**: 1685 - 1804
  - *Start*: Publication of Locke's major works and the Glorious Revolution context
  - *End*: Kant's death (1804) marks the transition to German Idealism and Romanticism
  
- **Geographic**: Western Europe (primarily Britain, France, German states, Scotland) with connections to North America
  - **British Isles**: England, Scotland (the Scottish Enlightenment was particularly influential)
  - **France**: Paris as the epicenter, with provincial figures
  - **German States**: Prussia, various principalities
  - **Other**: Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, American colonies

- **Intellectual**: Ideas that unite this network include:
  - Rationalism and empiricism as methods of inquiry
  - Natural rights and social contract theory
  - Religious tolerance and deism/skepticism
  - Political liberalism and constitutionalism
  - Economic theory (mercantilism critique, free trade)
  - Educational reform and human perfectibility
  - Scientific method applied to society

## Seed Figures

1. **John Locke** (1632-1704): The "Father of Liberalism." His *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* and *Two Treatises of Government* established foundational concepts of empiricism, natural rights, and social contract theory that influenced virtually all subsequent Enlightenment thinkers.

2. **Montesquieu (Charles-Louis de Secondat)** (1689-1755): French political philosopher whose *The Spirit of the Laws* articulated the separation of powers doctrine and comparative political analysis. Direct influence on American constitutional framers.

3. **Voltaire (François-Marie Arouet)** (1694-1778): The quintessential philosophe. Prolific writer, correspondent, and public intellectual who championed civil liberties, freedom of religion, and free trade. His network of correspondents spanned Europe.

4. **Jean-Jacques Rousseau** (1712-1778): Controversial figure whose *Social Contract* and *Emile* influenced political theory and education. His ideas about the "general will" and critique of civilization made him both central and contested within the Enlightenment.

5. **David Hume** (1711-1776): Scottish philosopher and historian whose empiricist epistemology, skepticism about religion and causation, and works on human nature were profoundly influential. Close friend of Adam Smith and correspondent with many French philosophes.

6. **Immanuel Kant** (1724-1804): German philosopher who sought to synthesize rationalism and empiricism. His essay "What is Enlightenment?" (1784) provided the movement's most famous self-definition: "Sapere aude" (Dare to know).

7. **Adam Smith** (1723-1790): Scottish moral philosopher and economist whose *Theory of Moral Sentiments* and *Wealth of Nations* founded classical economics and established the framework for understanding commercial society.

### British Empiricists and Political Thinkers
English philosophers and political theorists building on Locke's foundations.

### German Aufklärung
The German Enlightenment, especially centered in Prussia and university towns.
- Key figures: Kant, Wolff, Lessing, Mendelssohn, Herder
- Key venues: Berlin Academy, Königsberg University

### Physiocrats and Economists
Economic theorists, particularly the French Physiocrats and early classical economists.

### American Enlightenment Figures

### Scientific-Mathematical Circle
Natural philosophers and mathematicians whose work intersected with Enlightenment thought.

### Religious Reformers and Critics
Deists, religious skeptics, and advocates for toleration.
- Key figures: Toland, Collins, d'Holbach, La Mettrie
- Key themes: Deism, atheism, religious toleration

## Exclusion Criteria

The following types of figures will generally NOT be included unless they have substantial documented intellectual relationships with core network members:

1. **Political figures without intellectual work**: Monarchs, ministers, and politicians are excluded unless they were themselves intellectuals or patrons with documented intellectual exchanges (e.g., Frederick the Great is IN; most other rulers are OUT)

2. **Pure scientists without philosophical engagement**: Scientists whose work was purely technical without engagement in broader Enlightenment debates

3. **Literary figures without philosophical content**: Novelists, poets, and playwrights who did not engage with Enlightenment ideas (though many did and are included)

4. **Pre-1650 figures**: While the Enlightenment built on earlier thinkers (Descartes, Bacon, Hobbes), we focus on the 18th-century movement itself. Key transitional figures (Locke, Newton, Leibniz) are included as foundations.

5. **Post-1810 figures**: The transition to Romanticism and German Idealism marks our endpoint. Figures like Hegel and the early Romantics are excluded.

6. **Peripheral correspondents**: People who exchanged a single letter with a philosophe but had no sustained intellectual relationship

## Scope Considerations

Given the ~200 person limit, we must be selective. Priority will be given to:
1. Figures with documented intellectual relationships (correspondence, collaboration, mentorship)
2. Authors of influential works that shaped the movement
3. Figures who appear across multiple subgroups (connectors)
4. Figures with primary source documentation of relationships

We will need to make difficult exclusion decisions, particularly for:
- Minor contributors to the *Encyclopédie*
- Peripheral salon attendees
- Second-tier German academics
