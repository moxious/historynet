**Researcher**: AI Agent (Claude)

## Phase Completion

### Phase 1: Scoping
- [x] Define intellectual movement
- [x] Establish temporal boundaries
- [x] Establish geographic scope
- [x] Identify seed people
- [x] List expected subgroups
- [x] Document in 01-scope.md

### Phase 2: Enumeration
- [x] Research seed person connections
- [x] Expand outward through documented relationships
- [x] Organize into subgroups
- [x] Validate dates against reliable sources
- [x] Document in 02-enumeration.md

### Phase 3: Relationship Mapping
- [x] Document relationships with evidence
- [x] Validate date ranges
- [x] Flag speculative relationships
- [x] Document in 03-relationships.md

### Phase 4: Objects, Locations, Entities
- [ ] Identify key works (04-objects.md)
- [ ] Identify significant locations (05-locations.md)
- [ ] Identify relevant entities (06-entities.md)

### Phase 5: Review and Gap Analysis
- [ ] Review completeness
- [ ] Verify edge source/target IDs
- [ ] Check for orphan nodes
- [ ] Document in 07-review-notes.md

### Phase 6: Conversion
- [ ] Generate nodes.json
- [ ] Generate edges.json
- [ ] Create manifest.json
- [ ] Validate against GRAPH_SCHEMA.md

## Notes

- Initial seed figures provided: Locke, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Hume, Kant, Smith
- This network spans multiple national traditions (British, French, German/Prussian)
- The Enlightenment is a large intellectual movement; careful scoping needed to stay within ~200 person limit
- **Phase 2 Notes**: 
  - Enumerated 58 figures across 10 subgroups
  - Well below 200 limit; room for expansion in later phases
  - Strong coverage of French philosophes, Scottish Enlightenment, and seed figures' networks
  - Research gaps identified: Italian, Dutch, Swiss, Spanish Enlightenment; women intellectuals beyond salon hostesses
  - Preliminary relationship data captured in "Connections" fields—ready for formal documentation in Phase 3
- **Phase 3 Notes**:
  - Documented ~116 relationships across 9 categories
  - Categories: Foundational influences, French philosophes, Scottish Enlightenment, German Aufklärung, British empiricist/political, American connections, Scientific-mathematical, Salon network, Patronage
  - Relationship types used: influenced, taught, studied_under, corresponded_with, collaborated_with, knows, opposed, patronized
  - All relationships include evidence citations from scholarly secondary sources
  - 3 relationships marked as speculative: Voltaire's role in Rousseau exposure, Smith meeting Voltaire, Smith's intended dedication to Quesnay
  - Identified cross-cutting patterns: Encyclopédie as network hub, "quarrel" pattern (Diderot-Rousseau, Hume-Rousseau, etc.), mentorship chains
  - Ready for Phase 4: Objects, Locations, and Entities
