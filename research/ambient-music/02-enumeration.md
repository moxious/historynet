## Precursors & Conceptual Foundations

### Erik Satie (1866-1925)
- **Role**: Composer
- **Location**: Paris, France
- **Significance**: Inventor of "musique d'ameublement" (furniture music) in the 1910s-1920s—music designed to be background rather than foreground, to "soften daily noise" rather than demand attention. Brian Eno explicitly cited Satie's furniture music as a direct precursor to ambient music. His concept of music that "mingles with the sound of knives and forks at dinner" anticipated ambient's core philosophy.
- **Key Works**: *Musique d'ameublement* (1917-1920), *Gymnopédies*, *Gnossiennes*
- **Connections**: John Cage (acknowledged influence), Brian Eno (cited as precursor)
- **Notes**: Though little recognized in his lifetime, his ideas were rediscovered post-WWII.

### Luigi Russolo (1885-1947)
- **Role**: Composer, painter, Futurist
- **Location**: Milan, Italy
- **Significance**: Author of the Futurist manifesto "The Art of Noises" (1913), which proposed expanding music to include all sounds. Invented noise-generating instruments called "intonarumori." His ideas about incorporating environmental and mechanical sounds presaged musique concrète and ambient's expanded sonic palette.
- **Key Works**: "The Art of Noises" manifesto (1913), *Risveglio di una città* (1913)
- **Connections**: Pierre Schaeffer (conceptual precursor), John Cage (influence)
- **Notes**: More influential as theorist than practitioner; few recordings survive.

### John Cage (1912-1992)
- **Role**: Composer, music theorist, philosopher
- **Location**: New York, USA
- **Significance**: Central conceptual precursor to ambient music. *4'33"* (1952) redefined music to include environmental sound and silence. His work on indeterminacy, chance operations, and attention to ambient noise directly influenced Eno's thinking. Cage taught that silence isn't empty—it's filled with ambient sound.
- **Key Works**: *4'33"* (1952), *Music of Changes* (1951), *Imaginary Landscape* series
- **Connections**: Erik Satie (acknowledged influence), Morton Feldman (close collaborator), Brian Eno (cited as influence), David Tudor (performer), La Monte Young (student/influence)
- **Notes**: Zen Buddhist philosophy shaped his approach to listening and environmental awareness.
