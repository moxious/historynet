## Phase Completion

### Phase 1: Scoping
- [x] Define intellectual movement
- [x] Establish temporal boundaries
- [x] Establish geographic scope
- [x] Identify seed people
- [x] List expected subgroups
- [x] Document in 01-scope.md

### Phase 2: Enumeration
- [x] Research seed person connections
- [x] Expand outward through documented relationships
- [x] Organize into subgroups
- [x] Capture standardized information for each person
- [x] Validate dates against reliable sources
- [x] Document in 02-enumeration.md

### Phase 3: Relationship Mapping
- [x] Document relationships with evidence
- [x] Validate dates
- [x] Flag speculative relationships
- [x] Document in 03-relationships.md

### Phase 4: Objects, Locations, Entities
- [x] Identify key works (albums, equipment, publications)
- [x] Identify significant locations
- [x] Identify relevant entities (labels, studios, movements)
- [x] Document in 04-objects.md, 05-locations.md, 06-entities.md

### Phase 5: Review and Gap Analysis
- [ ] Review all individuals for completeness
- [ ] Verify all edge source/target IDs exist
- [ ] Check for orphan nodes
- [ ] Document in 07-review-notes.md

### Phase 6: Conversion
- [ ] Generate nodes.json
- [ ] Generate edges.json
- [ ] Create manifest.json
- [ ] Validate against GRAPH_SCHEMA.md

| Entities identified | 35 |

## Notes

- Network centered on Brian Eno as primary anchor
- Focus on "artists' artists" - influential figures in development of the form, not popular artists
- Includes precursors, equipment makers, and practitioners
- Temporal scope spans from early electronic music pioneers (~1920s) through the crystallization and spread of ambient as a genre (~1990s)

### Phase 2 Notes (2026-01-18)
- Enumerated 57 individuals across 8 subgroups
- Strong representation of German electronic school (14), conceptual precursors (14), and instrument makers (10)
- Brian Eno connections well-documented; Eno emerges as highly connected node
- Includes "artists' artists" like Conny Plank, King Tubby, La Monte Young who were more influential than famous
- Japanese ambient (kankyō ongaku) included with 3 figures
- Research gaps noted: post-1995 figures excluded by scope; could expand Can/more Krautrock

### Phase 3 Notes (2026-01-18)
- Documented 157 relationships across 20 categories
- Relationship types: influence (52), collaboration (48), teacher-student (14), production (18), co-founding (16), family (1), other (8)
- Brian Eno emerges as most connected figure (28 relationships) - central hub of network
- Other highly connected figures: John Cage (12), Conny Plank (11), Robert Moog (10), La Monte Young (10)
- Key bridge figures identified connecting subgroups: Eno, Stockhausen, Hassell, Plank
- 3 speculative relationships flagged with appropriate strength markers
- Cross-network bridges documented connecting German, British, American, French, and Japanese scenes
- Some relationships reference figures not in enumeration (noted for context but edges point to unlisted nodes)

### Phase 4 Notes (2026-01-18)
- **Objects (72 total)**: 52 albums/recordings, 12 instruments/equipment, 8 publications
  - Foundational albums documented: *Music for Airports*, *Phaedra*, *4'33"*, etc.
  - Key instruments: Moog synthesizers, VCS3, Buchla, theremin, ondes Martenot
  - Critical publications: Eno's ambient manifesto, Cage's *Silence*, Schaeffer's *Traité*
- **Locations (32 total)**: 12 cities, 10 studios, 6 institutions, 4 venues
  - Geographic clusters: Berlin (German school), Paris (musique concrète), New York (minimalism), London (British experimental)
  - Key studios: Conny Plank's (German-British connection), GRM (electroacoustic), King Tubby's (dub innovation)
- **Entities (35 total)**: 14 bands, 8 labels, 8 movements, 5 organizations
  - Bands: Tangerine Dream, Cluster, Harmonia, Neu!, Kraftwerk, YMO
  - Labels: Obscure Records (Eno), Ohr/Brain (German), EG (British ambient)
  - Movements: Ambient, Musique Concrète, Minimalism, Berlin School, Dub
  - Companies: Moog, EMS, Buchla (instrument makers enabling the form)
