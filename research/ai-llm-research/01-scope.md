# AI/LLM Research Network - Scope Definition

**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Researcher**: AI Agent (Claude)

## Movement Description

The modern AI/LLM research movement represents the deep learning revolution that has transformed artificial intelligence from a niche academic field into one of the most influential technological forces of the 21st century. Beginning with breakthroughs in neural network architectures around 2012 (particularly AlexNet), this movement accelerated dramatically with the development of transformer architectures (2017) and large language models (2018-present).

This network maps the key researchers, engineers, and leaders who have driven the development of modern AI systems, with particular focus on large language models (LLMs) like GPT, LLaMA, and Claude. The network captures the interconnected world of AI research labs, the flow of talent between organizations, collaborative relationships, and intellectual lineages.

## Boundaries

- **Temporal**: 2012 - present (2026)
  - *Start*: AlexNet and the deep learning revolution
  - *Key inflection*: 2017 "Attention Is All You Need" transformer paper
  - *Acceleration*: 2018+ GPT-1, BERT, and the LLM era
  
- **Geographic**: International, with major centers in:
  - San Francisco Bay Area (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google/DeepMind US)
  - London (DeepMind)
  - Paris (Meta AI FAIR, Mistral)
  - Montreal/Toronto (MILA, Vector Institute)
  - New York (Meta AI, various)
  - Beijing/Shanghai (Chinese AI labs - if expanded)

- **Intellectual**: United by work on:
  - Deep learning and neural networks
  - Large language models and transformers
  - AI safety and alignment
  - Scaling laws and emergent capabilities

## Expected Subgroups

### Core Lab/Organization Groups
- **OpenAI**: Founders, researchers, leadership (GPT series, ChatGPT, DALL-E)
- **Meta AI / FAIR**: LeCun's team, LLaMA developers, open research advocates
- **DeepMind**: Hassabis, Legg, Silver, etc. (AlphaGo, AlphaFold, Gemini)
- **Google Brain / Google AI**: Dean, Norvig, transformer inventors
- **Anthropic**: Amodei siblings and OpenAI departures (Claude, constitutional AI)
- **xAI**: Musk's new venture, Grok development

### Academic Lineages
- **Toronto School**: Hinton's students and collaborators (Sutskever, Kingma, etc.)
- **Montreal School**: Bengio and MILA (Goodfellow, Courville, etc.)
- **Stanford AI**: Ng, Fei-Fei Li, and students (Karpathy, etc.)
- **Berkeley AI**: Abbeel, Levine, and robotics/RL focus

### Thematic Groups
- **AI Safety/Alignment**: Those focused on existential risk and alignment
- **Scaling Laws Researchers**: Those who established compute scaling relationships
- **Open Source/Weight Advocates**: Those pushing for open AI development
- **AI Policy**: Those involved in governance and regulation

## Exclusion Criteria

- **Pure business/investor figures** without significant technical or research involvement
- **Journalists and commentators** unless they have shaped the field's direction
- **Hardware engineers** unless directly involved in AI architecture decisions
- **Figures from unrelated AI subfields** (e.g., symbolic AI purists without connection to deep learning)
- **Chinese AI researchers and labs** (ByteDance, Baidu, Alibaba DAMO, Tsinghua, etc.) are **explicitly excluded** from this network due to source verification challenges and geopolitical complexity. This is a scoping decision, not a judgment of importance. A separate "Chinese AI Research" network could be created in the future.
