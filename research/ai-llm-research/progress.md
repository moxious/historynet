## Phase Completion

### Phase 1: Scoping
- [x] Define intellectual movement
- [x] Establish temporal boundaries
- [x] Establish geographic scope
- [x] Identify seed people
- [x] List expected subgroups
- [x] Document in 01-scope.md

### Phase 2: Enumeration
- [x] Research seed person connections
- [x] Expand through documented relationships
- [x] Organize into subgroups
- [x] Capture details for each person
- [x] Document in 02-enumeration.md

### Phase 3: Relationship Mapping
- [x] Document relationships with evidence
- [x] Validate dates
- [x] Flag speculative relationships
- [x] Document in 03-relationships.md

### Phase 4: Objects, Locations, Entities
- [ ] Identify key works (papers, models)
- [ ] Identify significant locations
- [ ] Identify relevant entities (labs, companies)
- [ ] Document in 04-objects.md, 05-locations.md, 06-entities.md

### Phase 5: Review and Gap Analysis
- [ ] Review completeness
- [ ] Verify edge source/target IDs
- [ ] Check for orphan nodes
- [ ] Document in 07-review-notes.md

### Phase 6: Conversion
- [ ] Generate nodes.json
- [ ] Generate edges.json
- [ ] Create manifest.json
- [ ] Validate against schema
- [ ] Place in public/datasets/

## Statistics

## Notes

- Initial seed list provided by user focuses on OpenAI founders and Meta AI researchers
- This is a contemporary network (2012-present) rather than historical
- Many figures are still active, so relationships are ongoing
- Expanded to include DeepMind, Anthropic, Google Brain, academic pioneers
- Chinese AI explicitly excluded (noted in scope document)
- 91 unique individuals enumerated across 17 subgroups
- Phase 2 completed 2026-01-18
- Phase 3 completed 2026-01-18
- Custom relationship types added: co_founded, recruited, departed_from, co_authored, employed
