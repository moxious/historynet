## Phase Completion

### Phase 1: Scoping
- [x] Define intellectual movement
- [x] Establish temporal boundaries
- [x] Establish geographic scope
- [x] Identify seed people
- [x] List major subgroups or circles
- [x] Document in 01-scope.md

### Phase 2: Enumeration
- [x] Research seed person connections
- [x] Expand outward through documented relationships
- [x] Organize into subgroups
- [x] Validate dates against reliable sources
- [x] Document in 02-enumeration.md

### Phase 3: Relationship Mapping
- [x] Document relationships with evidence
- [x] Assign relationship types per GRAPH_SCHEMA.md
- [x] Flag speculative relationships
- [x] Document in 03-relationships.md

### Phase 4: Objects, Locations, Entities
- [x] Identify key works (books, papers, patents)
- [x] Identify significant locations
- [x] Identify organizations and institutions
- [x] Document in 04-objects.md, 05-locations.md, 06-entities.md

### Phase 5: Review and Gap Analysis
- [x] Verify all edge source/target IDs exist
- [x] Check for orphan nodes
- [x] Identify missing evidence
- [x] Document in 07-review-notes.md

### Phase 6: Conversion to Graph Schema
- [x] Generate nodes.json
- [x] Generate edges.json
- [x] Create manifest.json
- [x] Validate against GRAPH_SCHEMA.md
- [x] Place in public/datasets/cybernetics-information-theory/

## Notes

- Network focuses on the emergence of cybernetics, information theory, and systems thinking as foundational frameworks
- Temporal scope: roughly 1940s-1970s, with roots extending into the 1930s
- Key intellectual themes: feedback, control, communication, computation, self-organization
- Strong interdisciplinary character: mathematics, engineering, biology, psychology, anthropology, management

### Phase 2 Completion Notes (2026-01-18)
- Enumerated 82 individuals across 10 subgroups
- Subgroups: Founding Figures (7), Information Theory (9), Computing (8), Macy Conference (10), Neurophysiology (5), British Cybernetics (7), Systems Theory (9), Second-Order (5), AI/Cognitive Science (12), Precursors (10)
- Many figures span multiple subgroups reflecting interdisciplinary nature
- Key overlaps: Shannon, von Neumann, Turing, Ashby, McCulloch, Bateson, von Foerster, Maturana
- Research gaps identified: Soviet cybernetics, women in cybernetics, post-1970s AI, French reception

### Phase 3 Completion Notes (2026-01-18)
- Documented 195 relationships across all subgroups
- Relationship type distribution: collaborated_with (89), knows (41), influenced (32), taught/studied_under (19)
- Evidence strength: 73% strong, 22% moderate, 4% weak, 1% speculative
- Key relationship clusters: Wiener-McCulloch-Pitts triad, Bell Labs circle, Macy Conference network, Ratio Club

### Phase 4 Completion Notes (2026-01-18)
- 48 objects: foundational texts, neural network papers, systems theory books, computing hardware
- 31 locations: research centers (MIT, Bell Labs, BCL), conferences, British institutions
- 37 entities: conferences/societies, research labs, movements, funding organizations

### Phase 5 Completion Notes (2026-01-18)
- Validated all data for schema compliance
- Identified 1 orphan node (Konrad Zuse) - acceptable due to isolated German development
- Flagged 3 speculative relationships
- Documented gaps: Soviet cybernetics, women in cybernetics, geographic concentration
- Overall quality: 85% coverage, 95% evidence quality, 100% schema compliance
- **Ready for conversion to graph schema**

### Phase 6 Completion Notes (2026-01-18)
- Generated nodes.json with 175 nodes (82 people, 48 objects, 31 locations, 37 entities minus some consolidation)
- Generated edges.json with 179 relationships
- Created manifest.json with full metadata
- Validated all IDs and relationship types against GRAPH_SCHEMA.md
- Dataset placed in public/datasets/cybernetics-information-theory/
- **Dataset complete and ready for use in application**
