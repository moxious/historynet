## Research Gaps

1. **Soviet cybernetics**: Figures like Andrei Kolmogorov (algorithmic information theory), Viktor Glushkov, and others worked in parallel but are not included due to scope limitations.

2. **Later AI researchers**: Post-1970s figures (Rumelhart, Hinton, etc.) would extend beyond scope but are historically significant.

3. **French connections**: The French reception of cybernetics (Jacques Lacan's interest, Simondon) not fully covered.

4. **Women in cybernetics**: Beyond Mead and Meadows, the role of women (ENIAC programmers, others) deserves more attention.

5. **Asian contributions**: Japanese cybernetics movement and others not covered.

6. **Biographical details**: Some dates and locations need verification against primary sources.

- **John von Neumann**: Computing + Macy Conferences + influenced AI
- **Alan Turing**: Computing + Ratio Club + theoretical foundation for AI
- **W. Ross Ashby**: Seed figure + Ratio Club + BCL (second-order)
