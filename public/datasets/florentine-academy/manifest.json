  "description": "The Platonic Academy of Florence (c. 1462–1520), centered on Marsilio Ficino's villa at Careggi under Medici patronage. This network explores the rediscovery and translation of ancient Hermetic and Neoplatonic texts, the synthesis of Neoplatonism with Christianity, and the development of Christian Kabbalah. The Academy was instrumental in transmitting the prisca theologia—the notion of an ancient wisdom tradition linking Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Plato—to Renaissance Europe.",
