    "biography": "Elias Ashmole (1617-1692) was a celebrated English antiquary, politician, and student of the occult sciences. He is best known as the founder of the Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford and for providing the earliest documented evidence of Freemasonry in England. On October 16, 1646, at 4:30 PM, Ashmole recorded in his diary that he was 'made a Free Mason' at a lodge in Warrington, Lancashire, alongside Colonel Henry Mainwaring. This is the first specific, dated record of a speculative (non-operative) Freemason being initiated in an English lodge. Ashmole remained a member for the rest of his life, attending another lodge meeting 36 years later in 1682 at Masons' Hall in London.",

The book included a mythologized history tracing Freemasonry from Adam through biblical and historical figures, the Charges of a Free-Mason establishing moral and ethical framework, General Regulations compiled by George Payne, and Masonic songs.
