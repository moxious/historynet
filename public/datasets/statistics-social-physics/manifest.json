  "description": "This network traces the intellectual lineage from probability theory's mathematical foundations through the ambitious project of 'social physics'—the attempt to apply mathematical methods to understand human society. Beginning with Laplace's foundational work on probability and the 'calculus of chance,' through Quetelet's vision of the 'average man' and statistical laws governing society, to Fisher's modern statistical inference—this network reveals how the dream of a mathematical science of society shaped the development of statistics itself.\n\nThe period (c. 1750-1950) encompasses the transformation of probability from a tool for gambling into a universal framework for scientific reasoning, the controversial application of quantitative methods to social phenomena, and the emergence of statistics as a discipline with profound implications for science, policy, and society.",
