  "description": "The revolutionary intellectual network that emerged in the 1940s around cybernetics, information theory, and systems thinking. Traces the interconnected developments in feedback systems, communication theory, computation, and their applications from the Macy Conferences through the foundations of artificial intelligence. Includes Norbert Wiener, Claude Shannon, Alan Turing, John von Neumann, and the interdisciplinary communities that forged our modern understanding of information, control, and complex systems.",
