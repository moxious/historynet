    "biography": "Born at Altseidenberg near Görlitz in Upper Lusatia, Boehme was the son of a farmer and became a shoemaker. In 1600, he experienced a profound mystical vision triggered by sunlight reflected off a pewter dish, which he described as revealing the nature of God, creation, and the relationship between good and evil. His first work, Aurora (1612), circulated in manuscript and provoked opposition from the Lutheran pastor Gregorius Richter, who forbade him from writing. After several years of silence, he resumed writing around 1619 and produced numerous works including Mysterium Magnum. He was summoned to Dresden in 1624 to answer charges of heresy but was found sufficiently orthodox. He died in Görlitz in November 1624.",

He held academic positions including professor at the University of Marburg, where he also wrote metaphysical works. Later he became archdeacon in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland). In 1617, Lucas Jennis of Frankfurt published his emblem book Societas Jesu et Rosae Crucis Vera (The True Society of Jesus and the Rosy Cross), one of the earliest emblem books associated with Rosicrucian thought. The work contains 40 emblems organized in four decades, each featuring the mystical heart in various spiritual states—chained, crowned, nailed to a cross, with wings, under attack by the devil—depicting stages of spiritual transformation. Later editions appeared as Emblemata sacra (1624, expanded to 50 emblems) and Emblematum sacrorum (1627). He also published Octaginta emblemata moralia nova (1630).",
