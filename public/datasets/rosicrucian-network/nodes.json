    "biography": "Born at Altseidenberg near Görlitz in Upper Lusatia, Boehme was the son of a farmer and became a shoemaker. In 1600, he experienced a profound mystical vision triggered by sunlight reflected off a pewter dish, which he described as revealing the nature of God, creation, and the relationship between good and evil. His first work, Aurora (1612), circulated in manuscript and provoked opposition from the Lutheran pastor Gregorius Richter, who forbade him from writing. After several years of silence, he resumed writing around 1619 and produced numerous works including Mysterium Magnum. He was summoned to Dresden in 1624 to answer charges of heresy but was found sufficiently orthodox. He died in Görlitz in November 1624.",

The work contains 40 emblems organized in four decades, each featuring the mystical heart in various spiritual states—chained, crowned, nailed to a cross, with wings, under attack by the devil—depicting stages of spiritual transformation. Later editions appeared as Emblemata sacra (1624, expanded to 50 emblems) and Emblematum sacrorum (1627). He also published Octaginta emblemata moralia nova (1630).",

As a leader of the Unity of the Brethren, he spent much of his life in exile due to religious persecution after the Battle of White Mountain (1620). He developed 'pansophia' - a comprehensive system integrating all knowledge for universal education. His major educational works include Didactica Magna, Orbis Sensualium Pictus, and Pansophiae Prodromus (1639). He knew Johann Valentin Andreae personally and admired his reform ideals. In 1641 he visited England at Samuel Hartlib's invitation to help establish educational reforms. His Labyrinth of the World (1623) contains allegorical references to Rosicrucians. He became the last bishop of the Unity of Brethren. He died in Amsterdam on November 15, 1670.",

He promoted the ideas of Comenius, collaborated closely with John Dury on religious reconciliation, and corresponded with figures including Robert Boyle and John Milton. He published works including A Description of the Famous Kingdome of Macaria (1641) and helped circulate Comenius's Pansophiae Prodromus. Over 25,000 folios of his papers survive, preserved at Sheffield. The Hartlib Circle prefigured the Royal Society, with many members later becoming fellows. He died in 1662.",

From the late 1620s, he committed himself to promoting unity among Protestants, seeking to reconcile Lutheran and Reformed churches through his 'irenicist' approach. He traveled extensively across Europe, meeting with Protestant princes and scholars. In England during the 1640s-50s, he was involved with Puritan causes, preached before Parliament, and worked under Cromwell as diplomat and scholar. With Hartlib he published The Reformed School (1648) and The Reformed Librarie-Keeper (1650), pioneering concepts in library science.

After returning to England around 1652, he trained as an attorney at Clifford's Inn while also practicing astrology. He was imprisoned during the Commonwealth for allegedly predicting Cromwell's death. In 1656 he married the widow of herbalist Nicholas Culpeper. His major works include The Holy Guide (1662), which fuses Rosicrucian medicine with Baconian ideals, borrowing heavily from Bacon's New Atlantis. He also wrote Theomagia (1662-64) and The Wise Man's Crown, or The Glory of the Rosie-Cross (1664). Frances Yates described him as 'a strange character... of a most extreme type,' while Elias Ashmole dismissed him as 'an ignoramus and a cheate.'
