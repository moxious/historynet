- **Infobox Panel**: Node/edge detail display with type-specific fields, images, internal links, evidence, natural language edge descriptions
- **Filtering**: Date range and text filters with URL sync, debounced inputs, collapsible panel
- **Search**: Instant highlighting with keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+K), clear visual distinction from filtering
- **Dataset Switching**: Dropdown with metadata display
- **URL State**: Deep linking for all view state
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions

**Shipped Datasets**: Disney Characters, Rosicrucian Network, Enlightenment, AI-LLM Research

See `HISTORY.md` for detailed implementation history and completion notes.

## Completed: M9-M11, M13, M14

The following milestones have been completed. See `HISTORY.md` for detailed task lists and implementation notes.

### M9 - Application Verification ✅
Systematic verification of all shipped features with principal-level code review. Key fixes: Enlightenment dataset registration, README link correction.

### M10 - UX Improvements ✅
Debounced filter inputs, simplified labels, InfoboxPanel hidden when no selection, filter panel collapsed by default, edge infobox natural language descriptions, search vs filter clarification.

### M11 - Graph Interaction Polish ✅
Memoized click handlers to prevent graph re-layout, physics tuning (reduced repulsion, added soft gravity), zoom/pan hint for discoverability, removed ID fields from infobox.

### M13 - Scenius Rebrand & Theme System ✅
Application rebranded from "HistoryNet" to "Scenius" with new tagline "Mapping collective genius". Full light/dark theme system with URL parameter support (`?theme=dark`), localStorage persistence, and theme-aware visualizations. New SVG favicon with interconnected nodes design.

### M14 - Timeline Improvements ✅
300px left margin for filter panel clearance, improved year label readability, initial zoom focus on first item, node-type legend matching graph view, verified infobox behavior parity. Gap collapse feature researched but deferred.

See `HISTORY.md` for detailed task lists and implementation notes for all completed milestones.

## Future: M12 - User Feedback

**Goal**: Allow users to submit feedback about graph data (missing nodes, incorrect information, suggested changes) without requiring a GitHub account. Feedback is captured as GitHub issues for dataset maintainers to review.

**Architecture Decision**: Migrate from GitHub Pages to Vercel to enable serverless API functions. This consolidates hosting and backend on a single platform.

**Note**: If M15 (Stable Resource URLs) is completed before this milestone, feedback forms should be integrated into the stable resource pages as well as the main graph view. Each node/edge page becomes a natural place for item-specific feedback.

**Deliverables**:

### Platform Migration
- Migrate deployment from GitHub Pages to Vercel
- Configure Vercel project with GitHub integration
- Set up environment variables for GitHub PAT
- Update documentation with new deployment URL

### Frontend Feedback Form
- Feedback form component (modal or slide-out panel)
- Context-aware: captures current dataset, selected node/edge, current URL
- Feedback types: missing node, missing edge, incorrect data, remove item, general
- Fields for description, suggested change, evidence URLs
- Optional contact email for follow-up
- Form validation and user-friendly error handling

### Serverless API Endpoint
- `/api/submit-feedback` endpoint (Vercel serverless function)
- Input validation and sanitization
- GitHub issue creation via GitHub API
- Structured issue body with all feedback details
- Appropriate labels applied automatically
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Return issue URL to user on success

### Security & Anti-Abuse
- Rate limiting by IP address
- Input sanitization (prevent injection)
- Honeypot field for bot detection
- Optional: CAPTCHA integration if abuse occurs

**Schema** (feedback submission):
```typescript
interface FeedbackSubmission {
  feedbackType: 'missing_node' | 'missing_edge' | 'incorrect_data' | 'remove_item' | 'general';
  dataset: string;
  selectedNodeId?: string;
  selectedEdgeId?: string;
  currentUrl?: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  suggestedChange?: string;
  evidenceUrls?: string[];
  evidenceText?: string;
  contactEmail?: string;
}
```

## Future: M15 - Stable Resource URLs

**Goal**: Give every node and edge across all datasets a permanent, shareable URL (permalink) that loads a standalone detail page. This enables external citation, bookmarking, and serves as the foundation for per-item user feedback in future milestones.

**Context**: Currently, items can be deep-linked via query parameters (e.g., `?dataset=disney&selected=person-mickey-mouse&type=node`), but these URLs are tied to the graph view. Stable resource URLs provide a cleaner, more "resource-like" URL structure that treats each node and edge as a first-class addressable resource.

**Deliverables**:

### URL Routing Architecture

New path-based routes (using HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility):

**Node URLs**:
```
/#/{dataset-id}/node/{node-id}
```
Examples:
- `/#/disney-characters/node/person-mickey-mouse`
- `/#/enlightenment/node/person-voltaire`
- `/#/rosicrucian-network/node/object-fama-fraternitatis`

**Edge URLs** (by source/target pair):
```
/#/{dataset-id}/from/{source-id}/to/{target-id}
```
Examples:
- `/#/disney-characters/from/person-mickey-mouse/to/person-minnie-mouse`
- `/#/enlightenment/from/person-voltaire/to/person-frederick-great`

Note: Edge URLs show **all edges** between the source and target nodes on a single page, since multiple relationships may exist between the same pair of entities.

### Standalone Resource Pages

- **Node Detail Page**: Renders the same content as the infobox panel (title, type, dates, description, biography, image, external links, etc.) but as a full standalone page
- **Edge Detail Page**: Renders edge information (relationship type, evidence, dates) plus summary cards for both source and target nodes. Shows all edges between the pair if multiple exist.
- **No graph visualization** on these pages—they are pure detail views
- Consistent styling with the main application
- Clear navigation back to the graph view ("View in Graph" button)

### Permalink & Share UI

- Add "Permalink" button/icon to the InfoboxPanel that copies the stable URL to clipboard
- Add "Share" button/icon that opens native share dialog (if available) or copies URL
- Visual feedback on copy (e.g., "Copied!" toast or icon change)
- Both buttons should be visible for both nodes and edges

### Meta Tags for SEO & Social Sharing

Each stable page should have dynamic meta tags:

- `<title>`: `{Node Title} | {Dataset Name} | HistoryNet`
- `<meta name="description">`: Short description from the node/edge
- `<meta property="og:title">`: Same as title
- `<meta property="og:description">`: Short description
- `<meta property="og:type">`: `article` or `website`
- `<meta property="og:url">`: Canonical URL of the page
- `<meta property="og:image">`: Node image if available, or default app image

Note: Dynamic meta tags in an SPA require either server-side rendering or a prerendering strategy. For GitHub Pages, consider using `react-helmet` or similar for client-side updates (works for users, limited for crawlers), or document that full SEO requires the Vercel migration in M12.

### Navigation & Back Links

- "View in Graph" button that navigates to `/#/?dataset={id}&selected={node-id}&type=node`
- Breadcrumb or header showing: `Dataset Name > Node Type > Node Title`
- If arriving from a graph deep link, browser back button should work correctly

## Future: M16 - Network Verification

**Goal**: Implement build-time CLI validation tools that verify all datasets conform to the graph schema before deployment. Invalid or malformed datasets should fail the build, preventing broken data from reaching production.

**Architecture**: TypeScript CLI scripts executed via npm, integrated into the GitHub Actions workflow after the build step. Validation runs against the JSON files in `public/datasets/`.

**Key Principle**: This is **build-time only** validation. No validation code should be shipped to the runtime bundle. The CLI tools live in a separate `scripts/` directory and are excluded from the production build.

**Deliverables**:

### CLI Tool Architecture

Create validation scripts in `scripts/validate-datasets/`:

```
scripts/
└── validate-datasets/
    ├── index.ts           # Main entry point
    ├── validators/
    │   ├── json-syntax.ts    # JSON parsing validation
    │   ├── manifest.ts       # Manifest schema validation
    │   ├── nodes.ts          # Node schema validation
    │   ├── edges.ts          # Edge schema validation
    │   └── cross-references.ts # Referential integrity
    ├── types.ts           # Validation types and interfaces
    └── reporter.ts        # Output formatting (errors, warnings, summary)
```

### JSON Syntax Validation
- Verify all JSON files parse without errors
- Report specific parsing errors with line numbers when possible
- Validate file encoding (UTF-8)

### Manifest Validation
- Required fields: `id`, `name`
- Recommended fields warning: `description`, `lastUpdated`, `version`
- Verify `id` matches directory name
- Validate `customRelationshipTypes` structure if present

### Node Validation
- **Required fields**: `id`, `type`, `title`
- **Type validation**: `type` must be one of `"person"`, `"object"`, `"location"`, `"entity"`
- **ID format**: Warning if ID doesn't follow `{type}-{slug}` pattern
- **Date validation**: If `dateStart` or `dateEnd` present, validate ISO 8601 or year-only format
- **URL validation**: If `imageUrl` or `externalLinks` present, validate URL format
- **Type-specific fields**: Warn if type-specific recommended fields missing (e.g., `biography` for persons, `objectType` for objects)
- **Duplicate detection**: Error if multiple nodes share the same ID

### Edge Validation
- **Required fields**: `id`, `source`, `target`, `relationship`
- **Relationship type**: Validate against known types or documented custom types in manifest
- **Date validation**: Same rules as nodes
- **Evidence warning**: Warning if edge lacks `evidence`, `evidenceNodeId`, or `evidenceUrl`
- **Duplicate detection**: Error if multiple edges share the same ID

### Cross-Reference Validation
- **Referential integrity**: Every `source` and `target` in edges must exist in nodes
- **Orphan detection**: Warning for nodes with no connected edges (configurable)
- **Evidence node validation**: If `evidenceNodeId` specified, verify it exists in nodes
- **Internal link validation**: Validate any node ID references in custom fields

### npm Scripts

Add to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "validate:datasets": "npx tsx scripts/validate-datasets/index.ts",
    "validate:datasets:strict": "npx tsx scripts/validate-datasets/index.ts --strict"
  }
}
```

Options:
- `--strict`: Treat warnings as errors
- `--dataset <id>`: Validate only a specific dataset
- `--quiet`: Only output errors and final summary
- `--json`: Output results as JSON (for CI parsing)

### Output Format

Human-readable output with severity levels:

```
🔍 Validating datasets...

📁 disney-characters/
  ✅ manifest.json - valid
  ✅ nodes.json - valid (47 nodes)
  ⚠️  edges.json - 3 warnings
     └─ edge-001: missing evidence field
     └─ edge-015: missing evidence field
     └─ edge-023: missing evidence field
  ✅ Cross-references valid

📁 enlightenment/
  ✅ manifest.json - valid
  ❌ nodes.json - 1 error
     └─ person-voltaire-2: duplicate node ID (line 45)
  ⏭️  Skipping further validation due to errors

📊 Summary:
   Datasets: 4 checked, 3 passed, 1 failed
   Errors: 1
   Warnings: 3

❌ Validation failed
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

Update `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to add validation step:

```yaml
- name: Validate datasets
  run: npm run validate:datasets

- name: Build for production
  run: npm run build
```

Validation runs **before** build to fail fast. Build artifacts are not created if datasets are invalid.

### Error Categories

| Category | Severity | Build Impact |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| JSON parse error | Error | ❌ Fails build |
| Missing required field | Error | ❌ Fails build |
| Invalid node type | Error | ❌ Fails build |
| Duplicate ID | Error | ❌ Fails build |
| Broken reference (source/target) | Error | ❌ Fails build |
| Invalid date format | Error | ❌ Fails build |
| Missing recommended field | Warning | ⚠️ Logged only |
| Missing evidence | Warning | ⚠️ Logged only |
| Orphan node | Warning | ⚠️ Logged only |
| Non-standard ID format | Warning | ⚠️ Logged only |

M9-M11, M13, M14 (Polish Complete) ✅
    │
    ├──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
    ▼                  ▼                  ▼
   M12                M15                M16
   (User Feedback)   (Stable URLs)      (Network Verification)
   [Vercel req'd]    [independent]      [independent, high value]
```

Note: M12, M15, and M16 can be worked on in parallel as they have no dependencies on each other. However:
- If M15 is completed before M12, the feedback system should be designed to integrate with stable resource pages.
- M16 is particularly high-value as it improves data quality for all future dataset development and catches errors before deployment.
